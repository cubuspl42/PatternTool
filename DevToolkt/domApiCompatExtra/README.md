# `domApiCompatExtra`

Typings for DOM APIs that are a part of [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), but are not included
in the [Kotlin DOM API compatibility library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-dom-api-compat).

Also, some relatively unopinionated DOM utils.
